Rules of the Mapdev repo
=====
Let's discuss the common ground we stand on. Some of this is common sense, others need clarification.

###### Rule 1
Be considerate to your fellow mapper. Do not be condescending.

###### Rule 2
Assets are expected to be maintained efficiently.

###### Rule 3
Senior contributors have more say in matters than a normal contributor, but are expected to openly consider the resolve of several like-minded contributors in a practical and sensible manner.

###### Rule 4
Contributors that abuse the repo or its collaborators will have their write access revoked.

###### Rule 5
Appropriate measures will be taken to modify assets of any kind to comply to defined standards when standards are not followed.

###### Rule 6
This is a community development repo, initiated by one and maintained by many, who in turn become one. Strive to make this repo continuously better for yourself and everyone else.

###### Rule 7
Taking credit is as important as giving credit. Balance is key.
