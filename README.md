Wily's Community Map Development Repo
=====

In this repo, the focus is mapping for [Urban Terror](http://urbanterror.info) (Q3UT4, idTech3), as a centralized location of code and resources that (initially) I've designed and built. I hope others will follow.

The UrT (Urban Terror) community lives and dies based on availability of 3rd-party development for the Frozen Sand developed, total conversion modification of Quake3. I represent a part of that community.

Content in this repo is for the community, by the community.

The concept of community developed maps will be new to most 3rd party UrT developers. It's a fascinating premise with massive potential. To connect with us, sign up for a GitHub account. Favorite/watch this repo. I'll add you as a contributor. You'll then be ready to ride the new wave of UrT map development.

### Getting started
It's easy, took me a day to get this whole thing together. It should take you no more than an hour to be completely set up.

While the mapdev repo remains new, there will undoubtedly be several bumps in the road, or growing pains. I think such a repo can be very beneficial to all developers and gamers in the UrT community.

#### Important
If you aren't familiar with the process of git, I wrote a file [HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md) to get you working with git, fast. It is imperative that you read this document first - before finding yourself frustrated and adverse to git.

The browser environment at GitHub is the simplest way to make quick updates. However, local access via git from your system is required to add/change/update/delete any assets within the repo.

### Sections
#### projects/
Development on maps happen here. Certain standards are enforced to ensure a sane community developers environment, for example, co-locating .pk3's at an externally hosted site. This way, redundant map assets are not bulking up the repo. Having systems of order in this environment will reduce many issues in the long-run.

The new [vanilla](projects/vanilla) map is a tech demo map for testing stuff like lighting, sizes, and placement of objects.

#### q3ut4/
These are assets that are ambiguous to any map project. For example, I've added a carefully designed 2048px levelshot template to [q3ut4/env](q3ut4/env) that allows for very high definition levelshot images.  

#### tools/
Making maps are easier when tasks can be automated. The tools here are mostly scripts that are meant to give mappers an edge in development.

More, new content is on the way. Contributors are welcome and encouraged to join. The idea of community developed maps holds great potential - so don't hesistate to jump in!
