A model warehouse for mappers
-----
This map will serve as a warehouse to "shop" for models. The idea is to contain every available model possible in a single map, for a mapper to walk around freely, picking models as desired.  

Hopefully, this leads to better maps, and more efficient uses of model resources.

All models for this map should be located in [q3ut4/models](../../q3ut4/models). The .map and .bsp will be active here. It is unlikely a .pk3 will be constructed - this is not a gameplay-enabled map. Usage should be contained to /devmap instances.

The models themselves could be copied locally into a pk3 archive and placed in your q3ut4 folder for quick usage (which you'd then remove when done).

Work on this warehouse map is set to begin soon. The preview image is 0 bytes as a placeholder. Progress updates are at [maps/readme.txt](maps/readme.txt).
