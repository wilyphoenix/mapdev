Description
-----
Vanilla is intended to be a base template for other maps. There's not much to it - though the assets of the map are rather useful.

Be sure to add two spaces at the end of the author name in the section above, as markdown requires it for newlines.

This is a developer's map built specifically for mapdev. It contains blocks that demonstrate various unit sizes. Lighting/shadows can be quickly/easily tested using different q3map2 compile options. The skybox is specially designed to show texture orientation when aligning skybox textures. This asset is being moved to [q3ut4/env/vanilla](https://github.com/wilyphoenix/mapdev/tree/master/q3ut4/env/vanilla).

All mapdev developers are welcome to mod/play/edit/etc this map. Please keep in mind this is
not a gameplay enabled map, though you're welcome to fork the map into whatever you please.
