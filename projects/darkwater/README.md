DARKWATER

Description
-----

Darkwater features torrential rain and rolling ocean waves in a dark setting. It also features enhanced collision detection with func_pendulum objects.

Unused assets from the original pk3 have been moved to [unused/](unused/) as part of a branch merge. This "unused" folder is only reference at this point for continued development. Eventually, a tool/script like the versioneer will strip unused assets automatically (or perhaps your favorite pk3 packager).

The community is expressly encouraged to bring new modifications to the map.
