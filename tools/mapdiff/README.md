Mapdiff tool
=====

Author: Originally written by $NulL
Announcement: HOW TO: Multi-Mapper Map Project With Diff/Merge Tool License and Information: README.txt

To facilitate community developed maps, this tool could become vital to allow multiple independent edits to a map. GtkRadiant does not support multi-party live edits over a network, so we'll need a way for several mappers to work on different parts of a map simultaneously.

Per $NulL's thread comment:

> I don't know what state the source is in, I have tinkered here and there since the first release.

Anyone that knows C++ who's willing to update and even maintain this tool would be beneficial to supporting map community development.
